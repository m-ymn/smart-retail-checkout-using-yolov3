An implementation of the yolov3 for the detection of objects for retail checkout system

# Description

This repo contains inference for YOLOv3 in Python. Training is done on Ubuntu linux OS with CUDA installed by following this repo https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet. Credit to Joseph Redmon for YOLO (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) and to Adrian Rosebrock for the Opencv implementation. This work is based on (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/)
